# 🌐 Digital Learning Content (DLC) Management System Training

Welcome to the official repository for the **DLC Management System Training Program**.  
This repository is designed to support participants and trainers in learning how to manage, customize, and deploy the Digital Learning Content (DLC) system — covering both **backend (Laravel)** and **mobile (React Native with Expo)** development.

---

## 🎯 Overview

The **DLC Management System** is a comprehensive platform designed to organize, distribute, and monitor digital learning materials for institutions.  
It provides:
- A **web-based admin interface** (Laravel) for managing users, digital content, and analytics.
- A **mobile app (React Native)** for learners to access videos, download content, and manage their learning profile.

This training guides participants through every major component — from understanding the system architecture to customizing the codebase, building APKs, and managing the entire source code workflow securely using GitHub.

---

## 🏫 Training Purpose

The training aims to equip participants with the practical skills required to:
1. Manage the DLC backend and frontend.
2. Build and customize the mobile app.
3. Handle version control using Git and GitHub.
4. Apply secure and maintainable software practices for institutional adoption.
